# rust_alpha

This is my try at writing a compiler for the Alpha-Notation used in my Systemnahe Informatik lecture at university.

## Current status

Development has just begun, almost everything is still missing.

## TODO

- [ ] Make it possible to customize the available memory cells (preferably by adding an option to the gui)
- [ ] Make progamm work with GUI 
	- [ ] (Customization of available accumulators)
	- [ ] (Customization of available memory cells)
		- if no memory cells are set all commands that require memory cells should be disabled ("compiling" with those commands included should fail)	
- [ ] Debug mode -> Step through each instruction
- [ ] Add tests (at least one for each command)
