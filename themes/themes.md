# Themes

This folder contains the theme `json` files for all build in themes. You can use them to create your custom theme.

The section `sh_theme` contains all colors used in the syntax highlighting. 

You can specify colors either by using their hex code or by using their names. The names that are supported can be found here: https://docs.rs/ratatui/latest/ratatui/style/enum.Color.html

See [cli#themes](../docs/cli.md#themes) for information on how to start the program with a specific theme.

The subfolder [llm-generated](llm-generated/) contains themes that where generated by llms.
